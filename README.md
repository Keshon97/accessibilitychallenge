### This challenge is to improve the accessibility of the Horiseon website. The focus was to change the non-semantic HTML of the website to semantic HTML. Accessibility is important so people who use assistive technology can have access to the your webpage. Here are the steps I took to fix it:

- I changed all the div tags to section tags.
- I gave the website a proper title.
- Added a descriptive title to each link.
- Added the id attribute to the SEO link to the webpage would scroll to that section.
- Gave each image an alt attribute and description.
- Changed the h2 tag in the footer to an h4.
- Consolidated the h2 and img tags in css since they were redundant.

## **What I Learned**

To check my webpage more as I am making changes. I was making changes and not refering back to my webpage to see if it worked properly. I spent more time fixing my own mistakes than fixing the websites.
